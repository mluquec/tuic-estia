subtitle.message= Tangible Interaction
description.message= TANGINT / FR is a working group devoted to Tangible Interaction, supported by the AFIHM and partner of Be-greifbare Interaktion. Open to researchers, engineers and designers who wish to invest the Tangible Interaction theme through the exchange of experiences, best practices and national and international networks.

objectiveone.message= Challenge
objectiveonedescription.message= The TANGINT / FR working group on Tangible Interaction, supported by the AFIHM (Francophone Association for Man-Machine Interaction), was created in 2011 by Nadine Couture and Guillaume Rivière of ESTIA. The objective of this working group is to federate the European community of Human-Machine Interaction, but also that of interaction design, around the research axis "Tangible Interaction". The challenge is that the European community appropriates this theme.
objectivetwo.message= Openness and good practices
objectivetwodescription.message= The TANGINT / FR working group is open to researchers, engineers and designers who wish to mature the theme of tangible interaction by sharing their experiences, best practices and national and international networks. After the synthesis of Shaer and Hornecker in 2011, the aim of this WG is to agree on the definition of tangibility, to propose design models, to formalize evaluations and tests of use, to combine the tangible interaction with tactile interaction on interactive tables, but also to explore new avenues of research such as physical state update and tangible core interactors.
